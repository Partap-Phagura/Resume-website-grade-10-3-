    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Over the years, I have liked to work and help people. So, I have gathered work experience through working with the family business, The Surrey Now Leader (newspaper), and volunteering with the City of Surrey. In India, our family business is farming, and we grow poplar trees. I have been involved with cutting them down and the planting process. With the City of Surrey, I delivered the newspaper in the 5th grade, and in high school, I got some volunteer hours with the libraries and other organizations. I mainly love volunteering since I get to help people, for which I take much pride.
